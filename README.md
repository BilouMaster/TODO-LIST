# Jauke's TODO-LIST for RMEx

### scripts-externalizer

- [ ] **Add** parameter: `EXTERNALIZE = "Materials"`
- [ ] **Add** parameter: `EXTERNALIZE_TO = "Scripts"`
- [ ] **Read** Scripts.rvdata2 paths in Game.ini
- [ ] **Read** its own =begin...=end to add scripts-loader

### scripts-loader

- [ ] **Try** new load method
- [ ] **Add** absolute/relative path recognition
- [ ] **Add** parameter: `LOAD_FROM = "Scripts" (String || Array)`

### scripts-compiler

- [ ] **Add** parameter: `COMPILE_FROM = "Scripts"`
- [ ] **Read** Scripts.rvdata2 paths in Game.ini

### [NEW] ups-viewer

- [ ] **Code** ups-viewer new script from orms' FPS_VIEWER

### [NEW] gex: graphics-extender

- [ ] **Code** gex new script from:

  - the orms' PIXELATE_SCREEN
  - the RME's camera/screen commands && Resolution.change
      
- [ ] **Extend** ups-viewer (add FPS with frame skipping to UPS)

### orms

- [ ] **Remove** `PIXELATE_SCREEN` and recommand gex + ups-viewer #Throw a message like "this command no longer exists
- [ ] **Fix** name input
- [ ] **Add** methods to set a `start_transition` and a `end_transition` in events for teleports and... reproduce all RM(2)K3 start/end transitions? :D
- [ ] **Change** `STOP_CURSOR_BLINKING` to fancy new `OLD_RM_CURSOR_BLINKING` (use a new system picture to make oldschool blink like RM2k(3) (graphical switch blinking))
- [ ] **Add** the feature `ICONS_FOR_ALL_TEXTS` to use `\I[id]` code like in dialogues, but for everything (name/description of objects, skills, etc) like RM2K(3) did with glyphs
- [ ] **Add** the feature `NO_MAP_SHADOWS` to deactivate the VXA shadow display in maps ingame.

### RME

- [ ] **Remove** camera/screen commands, Incubator (Resolution.change) and "unsafe?" #Throw a message like "this command no longer exists in RME, use gex... etc." when the methods are still used
- [ ] **Remove** unsafe?
- [ ] **Code** release-builder
- [ ] **Give** example of new organization:
```
- dev/
    - src/
        - current RME/src/ content
        ~ _list.rb (instead of build_schema.rb)

    - doc-samples/Data/
        - current RME/project/Data/ content

    - Doc.js        
    + README.rb

- release/ (automatically generated by release-builder)
    - RME for scripters/
        - Scripts/
            - RME/
                ~ current package (with version_number added in all scripts headers)
                + _list.rb
            + _list.rb
        + scripts-loader.rb
        + scripts-compiler.rb
    - README.txt
    ~ current RME.rb (with version_number added in header)

~ .gitignore
~ CHANGELOG.md (translated in english)
~ README.rb (translated in english + enhancement)
```
